#### Note: The loop used in the given code is to dynamically create the double array.
You don't need to fully understand this part yet, focus only on having access to an array
and has some numbers.

Main topics: arrays, primitive datatypes, concatenation, index, operators, loops

Example:
```
Input:
  [80, 88, 88, 84, 82, 78, 60, 68]

Output:
