### Create the `Canvas.java` file according to the following requirements.

  - declare these `instance variables`:
    - topic (String)
    - quizzes (ArrayList of Quiz objects)
    - modules (ArrayList of Module objects)

  - create these `constructors` to initialize the variables:
    - 1 argument (`String`): initialize the name and create an empty ArrayList of quizzes and modules
    - 3 arguments(`String, ArrayList<Quiz>, and ArrayList<Module>`):
    initialize the name and use the given ArrayLists to set up the starting values of all quizzers and modules

  - create a `toString()` to print the Canvas objects in this format:
    > $topic course
    >
    > Quizzes:
    >
    > [ArrayList of Quiz]
    >
    > Modules:
    >
    > [ArrayList of Module]
